Section A
1. In your own words, what is Java?
Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language used to create applications that can run on different devices. 
It was designed to be simple, portable, and secure.

2. Explain what makes Java unique as a programming language.
	•	Platform-independent: Java programs can run on any device with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
	•	Object-oriented: Java focuses on objects and classes.
	•	Automatic memory management: Java has garbage collection that handles memory automatically.
	•	Rich API: Java provides many built-in classes for tasks like networking, file handling, and GUI development.

3. List at least three areas where Java is used and briefly explain each one.
	•	Web Development: Java is used to build dynamic websites and web applications using frameworks like Spring.
	•	Mobile Development: Android apps are mainly built using Java.
	•	Enterprise Applications: Java is used in large companies for business software because it is reliable and secure.

4. What is the JDK? Describe its components and why developers need it.
	•	JDK (Java Development Kit) is a software development kit for Java programmers.
	•	Components:
	•	Javac: Java compiler to turn code into bytecode.
	•	JVM: Runs the bytecode.
	•	Java API & libraries: Pre-written code to help developers.
	•	Purpose: Developers need JDK to write, compile, and test Java programs.

5. What is the JVM? Explain its function in the Java program execution process.
	•	JVM (Java Virtual Machine) is a virtual machine that runs Java bytecode.
	•	Function: It converts bytecode into machine code that your computer can understand and executes it.
     It also makes Java programs platform-independent.

6. What is the difference between the JDK and the JVM? Give a simple example.
JDK (Java Development Kit) is a software development kit for Java programmers.
it is a tool for writing and compiling java programs, including complier (Javac), libraries and JVM.

While JVM (Java Virtual Machine) is a virtual machine that runs Java bytecode.
it is a tool for running Java progrms, part of JDK tht executes bytecode.

7. What is the purpose of javac (the Java compiler)?
javac converts Java source code (.java) into bytecode (.class) so it can run on the JVM.

8. Explain in your own words
a. What a Java class is:
A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines variables (attributes) and methods (functions) that objects will have.

b. What is an object in Java, and how is it related to a class:
An object is a real instance of a class. If a class is a blueprint, the object is the actual house built from it.

9. Why must every Java program have at least one class?
Because Java is an object-oriented language, all code must belong to a class. There’s no way to write standalone code outside a class.

10. What is the main method in Java and why is it important?
The main method is the entry point of a Java program. It tells the JVM where to start executing the program.



Section B
1. What is bytecode?
Bytecode is the intermediate code that the Java compiler generates.
 It is platform-independent and can be run on any machine with a JVM.

2. Explain the difference between source code, bytecode, and machine code in your own words.
	•	Source code: Human-readable code written by a programmer (.java).
	•	Bytecode: Compiled code from the source code (.class) that the JVM can understand.
	•	Machine code: Binary code that the computer’s processor executes directly.

3. What role does the JVM play when running a Java program?
The JVM reads bytecode, converts it into machine code, and executes it. 
It ensures Java programs can run on any device without modification.
